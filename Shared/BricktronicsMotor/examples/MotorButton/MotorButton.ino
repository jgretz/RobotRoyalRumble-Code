// Bricktronics Example: MotorButton
// http://www.wayneandlayne.com/bricktronics
// This example uses a LEGO NXT Motor and a Pushbutton sensor.
//
// This example starts the motor at full speed, then waits for
// the button to be pressed and released, then reverses direction.
// It does this forever! (or until you turn off the power,
// unplug stuff, or reprogram the Arduino.)
//
// This example uses a motor, so it needs more power than a USB port can give.
// We really don't recommend running motors off of USB ports (they will be
// slow and sluggish, other things won't quite work right, things can get hot)
// it's just not a good idea.  Use an external power supply that provides
// between 7.2 and 9 volts DC, and can provide at least 600 mA per motor
// (1 amp preferably). Two options that work really well are a 9V wall adapter
// or a 6xAA battery pack (2.1mm plug, center positive).

// This example can be run in three different ways. Pick one, and un-comment
// the code lines corresponding to your chosen method. Comment-out the lines
// for the other methods that you aren't using.

// 1. With a Bricktronics Shield - Include these lines and be sure to
// call BricktronicsShield::begin() in the setup() function below.
// You also need to install the Adafruit MCP23017 library:
//	https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-MCP23017-Arduino-Library
// Select the motor port (MOTOR_1 or MOTOR_2) and sensor port
// (SENSOR_1 through SENSOR_4) in the constructors below.
// If your chosen sensor port has jumpers (ports 3 and 4), connect pins 2-3 and 4-5.
//
// Config 1 - CFG_WNL_BS
//#include <Wire.h>
//#include <Adafruit_MCP23017.h>
//#include <BricktronicsShield.h>
//BricktronicsMotor m(BricktronicsShield::MOTOR_1);
//BricktronicsButton b(BricktronicsShield::SENSOR_1);
// Config end

// 2. With a Bricktronics Megashield - Include these lines but do not
// call BricktronicsShield::begin() in the setup() function below.
// Select the desired motor port (MOTOR_1 through MOTOR_6) and sensor port
// (SENSOR_1 through SENSOR_4) in the constructors below.
// Connect pins 2-3 and 4-5 on the chosen sensor port.
//
// Config 2 - CFG_WNL_BMS
//#include <BricktronicsMegashield.h>
//BricktronicsMotor m(BricktronicsMegashield::MOTOR_1);
//BricktronicsButton b(BricktronicsMegashield::SENSOR_1);
// Config end

// 3. With a Bricktronics Motor Driver - No additional #includes needed,
// just update the five pin assignments in the constructor below.
// The arguments are: enPin, dirPin, pwmPin, encoderPin1, encoderPin2
// There are a few considerations for pin assignments:
// A. pwmPin needs to be a pin with PWM capabilities (supports analogWrite)
//      Uno:       pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11
//      Mega 2560: pins 2 to 13 and 44 to 46
// B. There are three ways to connect the encoder pins (labeled T1/T2 on the board).
// ** Best performance: Both signals are connected to true interrupt pins (listed below).
// ** Good performance: The FIRST signal (T1) is connected to an interrupt pin, the second signa is a regular pin. This is the mode used for the Bricktronics Shield/Megashield. For this mode it is CRITICAL that the true interrupt pin is used for T1 and not T2.
// ** Low performance: Both signals are connected to non-interrupt pins.
// Regardless of which performance mode used, you MUST list the pin T1 before T2 in
//   the constructor, otherwise the encoder will be connected backwards and the
//   PID algorithm will get all confused and freak out.
// Location of true interrupt pins:
//      Uno:       pins 2 and 3
//      Mega 2560: pins 2, 3, 21, 20, 19, and 18
//
// The BricktronicsButton() argument is simply the pin the button is connected to,
// that is, wherever pin 1 of the Breakout board is connected (also connect the grounds).
// No worries about PWM or interrupt pins here.
//
// Config 3 - CFG_WNL_NS
//BricktronicsMotor m(3, 4, 10, 2, 5);
//BricktronicsButton b(7);
// Config end


void setup()
{
  // Only call this if you are using a Bricktronics Shield,
  // otherwise leave it commented-out.
  // Config 1 - CFG_WNL_BS
  //BricktronicsShield::begin();
  // Config end

  // Initialize the motor and button connections
  m.begin();
  b.begin();
}

int theSpeed = 150;

void loop()
{
  m.setFixedDrive(theSpeed);
  
  // Wait until the button is pressed
  while (b.isReleased())
  {
    // Nothing to do here
  }
  // To get here, the button was pushed!

  // While the button is held down, turn on the dynamic brake
  m.brake();

  // In order to debounce the button, we wait a little bit here
  delay(100);
  
  // Wait until the button is released
  while (b.isPressed())
  {
    // Nothing to do here
  }

  // In order to debounce the button, we wait a little bit here
  delay(100);

  // Reverse direction
  theSpeed *= -1;
